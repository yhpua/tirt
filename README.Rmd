# Introduction

This $R$ package contains the `tirt` function to estimate interpretation threshold values (with bootstrapped 95% CIs) of a multi-item questionnaire based on the item response theory (IRT) method developed by [Terluin et al[^1] ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36780033/). The package is developed to accompany the paper, "Using item response theory to estimate interpretation threshold values for the Frailty Index (FI) in community dwelling older adults."  Two example datasets are included in the `tirt` package to help users better understand its functionality. 


[^1]: Terluin et al Estimating meaningful thresholds for multi-item questionnaires using item response theory Qual Life Res. 2023 Jun;32(6):1819-1830. doi: 10.1007/s11136-023-03355-8.



## Installation
Please install the `tirt` package from [GitHub](https://github.com/yhpua/tirt) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yhpua/tirt")
```

## Example 1
We will use `tirt` to estimate the interpretation threshold of the Frailty Index (FI). The built-in synthetic dataset, `fi_dat`, includes all (binary and polytomous) items of the FI and a (binary) clinical anchor item that is placed in the last column.     

Note that setting the `B = 100` argument specifies 100[^2] bootstrap resamples to be used when computing the 95%CIs for the IRT-based thresholds.    

[^2]: Should have specified more (e.g., 1000) samples

```{r example1, cache = TRUE}
library(mirt)
library(tirt)
data(fi_dat)
summary(fi_dat)
tirt(fi_dat, B = 100)  
```


Suppose the `ffi_walk` item is collinear with the anchor condition. By specifying `clvar = "ffi_walk"`, `tirt` will remove this item in the initial estimation phase. Once `tirt` has estimated the FI threshold in terms of the latent trait level, it will re-fit an IRT model on all FI items (excluding the anchor item) and use the IRT parameters to find the expected FI score that corresponds to the latent threshold.   

```{r collinear, cache = TRUE}
tirt(fi_dat, clvar = "ffi_walk", B = 100)  
```





## Example 2
We will use `tirt` to estimate the IRT-based threshold of a multi-item questionnaire. The built-in `qol_dat` dataset is the simulated dataset described in Appendix Section 4 of the paper by [Terluin et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36780033/).    

Note that setting the `rform` argument to `sum` returns the expected (mean) questionnaire score. In Example 1, we set `rform` to `prop` (default) which expresses the expected score as a proportion of the number of items evaluated.    

```{r example2, cache=TRUE}
data(qol_dat)
tirt(qol_dat, B = 100, rform = "sum")
```
